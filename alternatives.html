				<h2 class="indexBlurb">Alternative Death Care Options</h2>
				<p class="indexBlurb">
					In the advent of trying to foster a more death-positive or death-conscious society, knowing your options 
					will always be the most important step. Listed below are five alternatives to conventional burial besides 
					the more mainstream green or natural options.
				</p>
				
				<h4 text-align="right" style="font-weight: 650;">Eternal Reefs:</h4>
				<p class="indexBlurb">
					An eternal reef is a biodegradable cement-adjacent object that helps foster life in the ocean. This is 
					accomplished by taking the cremated remains of an individual and mixing them with the aforementioned 
					product. The reef is then placed into the ocean by friends and/or family members where the reef will 
					become a habitat for fish and other marine life.

				<h4 text-align="right" style="font-weight: 650;">Space Burial:</h4>
				<p class="indexBlurb">
					While it may sound absurd, space burial is a very real thing. A sample or all of a person’s cremated 
					remains are shot into space where they will enjoy a trip up and back. These remains are not scattered 
					throughout space, however, as to not contribute to the growing issue of space debris.
				</p>
				
				<h4 text-align="right" style="font-weight: 650;">Aquamation:</h4>
				<p class="indexBlurb">
					While cremation is the use of fire and heat to turn human remains into ashes, aquamation is the use 
					of water and movement to turn remains into a sort of ultra-fertile slurry. This process usually 
					involves loading remains into a large tumbler with water and sloshing the mixture around until 
					the desired result is reached.
				</p>

				<h4 text-align="right" style="font-weight: 650;">Body Composting:</h4>
				<p class="indexBlurb">
					Body composting is a more radical and technically efficient method of decomposing large amounts of 
					human remains. Body composting involves the use of a large structure to put the remains into along 
					with carbon-heavy biodegradable materials in order to speed up the process of decomposition. The 
					resulting compost is a dense, nutrient, fertilizer that can be used to cultivate memorial trees 
					or gardens.
				</p>

				</figure>
				
				<h4 text-align="right" style="font-weight: 650;">Capsula Mundi:</h4>
				<p class="indexBlurb">
					Capsula Mundi is the proprietary practice of turning the deceased human body into a tree. 
					This is accomplished through the use of biodegradable seeded pods that utilize the nutrients 
					provided by the remains to sprout and eventually grow into whatever tree requested within the 
					particular climate.
				</p>

				<p class="indexBlurb">
					If any of these alternatives remotely pique your interest, you are heavily encouraged to do your 
					own research and find out what the proper death care solution is for you and your loved-ones.
