				<h2 class="indexBlurb">Conventional Burial</h2>
				<p class="indexBlurb">
					When we say conventional burial we mean a burial that you typically see and think about when you think of a burial. 
					One where there is a concrete vault and the body is buried in a casket. One downside of conventional burials is 
					that it takes up a lot of space. A standard grave is 2 and a half feet wide by 8 feet long. This does not include 
					the measurements of the concrete vault or lining that goes into the grave.

				<p class="indexBlurb">
					Each year, the US buries over 1.6 million tons of reinforced concrete. That is roughly 12 tons per vault, plus 
					imported steel from China and exotic woods from rainforest in South America for the creation of caskets. 
					Importing these creates a significant total of the carbon emissions. Most aspects of conventional burial 
					are non-biodegradable and last for hundreds or even thousands of years, this includes but is not limited to: 
					embalming fluids, steel and concrete vaults, and the caskets themselves. Along with the lack of biodegradable 
					material, embalmers have an eight times higher risk of contracting blood diseases such as leukemia, and three 
					times higher risk of ALS. Groundskeepers, on the other hand, are more than twice as likely to develop COPD. Both 
					of these professions are routinely exposed to chemicals known to cause various types of cancer as well as certain 
					neurological diseases.

				<p class="indexBlurb">
					Not only does conventional burial harm the environment, but it harms your bank account as well. The funeral industry, 
					on average, makes twenty billion dollars annually. The cost of the vaults, caskets, fluids, heavy machinery, and 
					procedures can set a family back $5,000 and $10,000 on average.
				</p>
				
				<p class="indexBlurb">
					Green burial removes all of these, however, returning to a more natural state of the burial process. Green, or natural, 
					burial is not only good for the environment but also costs thousands upon thousands of dollars less than conventional 
					burial. Green burial also has the added benefit of closeness to the deceased, both physically and emotionally. The green 
					burial process is much more modular, allowing families to grieve how they want and will not attempt to shelter the deceased 
					from the loved-one’s unless upon request.
